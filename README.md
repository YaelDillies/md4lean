# md4lean

a Lean wrapper for the [MD4C](https://github.com/mity/md4c) Markdown parser,
to be used in [doc-gen4](https://github.com/leanprover/doc-gen4),
replacing (CMark.lean)[https://github.com/xubaiw/CMark.lean].

The `md4c` implementation (`release-0.5.2` version, <https://github.com/mity/md4c/releases/tag/release-0.5.2>)
has been copied into this repository, so there is no need for other installation process.
We added a feature `MD_HTML_FLAG_MATHJAX` to it.
